# About me

By scrolling through my repositories one might conclude that I'm a learn-by-doing person. I'm interested in full-stack web development, machine learning, distributed systems and workflow optimization (sometimes by printing and soldering my own gear). I'd consider myself a polyglot programmer and I like building projects from the ground up, from ideation to deployment, using industry best practices. If you're interested, you can read about my recent endeavors on my [blog](https://www.danielsteman.com/) ðŸ˜Š.
