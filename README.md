# About me

I'm into full-stack web development, machine learning, distributed systems and workflow optimization (sometimes by printing and soldering [my own gear](https://www.
danielsteman.com/blog/7)). I'd consider myself a polyglot programmer and I like building projects from the ground up, from ideation to deployment, using industry best practices.
