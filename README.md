# About me

With a Bachelor's degree in Business and a Master's degree in Quantitative Finance, I delved into the world of backtesting and trading strategies. As I wrote my [thesis](https://github.com/danielsteman/thesis-msc-finance) on this topic, I discovered my passion for programming and decided to pursue a career as a software engineer. Since then, I have been immersed in learning and working on various projects, constantly seeking new challenges to further improve my skills.

Currently, I am involved in developing AI-powered applications and deploying them on Kubernetes, while also handling cloud provisioning for a leading Dutch enterprise. You can learn more about my professional experience on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielsteman/).

As a self-motivated individual, I am always looking for ways to optimize my workflow. Lately, I have been exploring [Neovim](https://github.com/danielsteman/.dotfiles/tree/master/nvim) and [NixOS](https://github.com/danielsteman/nixos-config), among other tools, to enhance my productivity. Additionally, I enjoy building random projects and sharing my experiences on [my personal website](https://danielsteman.com). If you're curious, feel free to check it out! :smiley:
