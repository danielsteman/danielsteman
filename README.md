# About me

I aim to optimize my workflow (currently down the rabbit hole of [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) and [NixOS](https://nixos.org/)), build random stuff and occasionally write about it [here](https://www.danielsteman.com) :smiley:.

Professionally I'm involved in developing AI-powered applications, deployments on Kubernetes and cloud provisioning. Read more about that [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielsteman/).
